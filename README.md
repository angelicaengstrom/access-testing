# access-testing

In the finished application, the user can enter a web address in the input field and run accessibility tests from various automated tools, such as Pa11y, IBM Equal Access, QualWeb and Google Lighthouse.

Below the form, the results of the accessibility tests are presented when a button is pressed on one of the accessibility test tools. The presented result shows the execution time of the tool and the total number of violations and warnings detected. The violations and the warnings have a descriptive heading, related to success criteria based on WCAG 2.1 and a description of the area where it was found. A warning is visualized in yellow tones and a violation in red tones
